          On this Chrismas Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />
          As Christmas brings warmth and joy to the world,
          I canâ€™t help but feel incredibly grateful for u and the light uâ€™ve brought into my life.
          Uâ€™ve become someone so special to me, and Iâ€™ve realized that what I feel for u goes beyond admiration
          it's love. I canâ€™t keep this in any longer I love u, Yes you heard it right i like you with all my heart.
          Whether or not u feel the same way, Iâ€™ll always cherish what we have, and
          I look forward to making more memories together. Wishing u a Christmas filled
          with all the love and happiness u deserve.
